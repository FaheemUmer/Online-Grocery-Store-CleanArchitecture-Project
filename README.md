🛒 Online Grocery Store – Clean Architecture

This project is a scalable and modular **Online Grocery Store** application designed using the **Clean Architecture** pattern. It allows browsing, searching, and managing grocery products while maintaining a strong separation of concerns across different layers.

---

## 📌 Objective

To implement an online grocery store system that supports essential e-commerce features while following Clean Architecture principles, making the codebase easy to maintain, test, and extend.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

This project is based on the Clean Architecture design, which divides the system into distinct layers:

Presentation Layer (UI)
└── communicates with
Application Layer (Use Cases)
└── communicates with
Domain Layer (Entities / Business Rules)
└── communicates with
Infrastructure Layer (Data Access, APIs, External Services)



Each layer has a clearly defined role and communicates only with its adjacent layer to ensure loose coupling.
